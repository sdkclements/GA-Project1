Game Rules and Info:

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

User Story One: 
As a user I should be able to start the game- this is done by selecting the number of disks you want to play with.

User Story Two: As a user I should be able to select a disk to move

User Story Three:As a user I should not be able to pick up disks below the first > this functionality needs to be readded

User Story Four: As a user I should be able to select where I want a disk to go.
User Story Five: Something should alert me when the game is over


As of yet unresolved issues:
Still want to add drag functionality.
Still need to set the input number to a variable i can reference in regards to score.
